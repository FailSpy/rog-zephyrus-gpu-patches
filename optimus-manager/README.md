## Optimus Manager

For using Optimus Manager on the Zephyrus, you will need to use a patched version that supports recognizing the iGPU, as the current one only recognizes Intel.

Here, you can find the link for Optimus Manager with support for AMD, made by Kr1ss:

If you're on Arch/Manjaro, you can find an AUR package here:
[optimus-manager-amd-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/optimus-manager-amd-git/)
